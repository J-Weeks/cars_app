#how to rails

1. Generate a new rails app by putting the following into the terminal: "rails new cars_app --database=postgresql"
*** plural is important
enter directory

2. start the rails server by entering the following into the terminal: “rails server"
In the browser navigate to http://localhost:3000
-check errors
-close server

3. Create a DB by entering the following into the terminal:
“rake db:create"
Restart the rails server and navigate to http://localhost:3000/cars
-should get “No route  matches [GET] “/cars” error'

4. open the config/routes.rb file and add the following:
get ‘cars’, to: ‘cars#index
-should get products controller error

5. App/controllers create a cars_controller.rb file
enter this in that file:

class CroductsController < ApplicationController def index end end

6.navigate back to http://localhost:300/cars
-should get a template error
-create a directory for the cars in the app/view directory
-look for erb file in app/views/cars/index.html.erb
     -if not there create one (can fill with gibberish text to check if working).

7.Create a DB table by the following
rails generate migration CreateCars make model year:decimal
rake db:migrate

8. Create rails model to access the date in the table
-create a ruby file in app/models/cars.rb
- put in that file the following
class Car < ActiveRecord::Base
end

9. Create cars in the DB/seeds.rb file
in the test case :

1.upto(5) do |num|
  Product.create(name: "Product_#{num}", price: num*3.99)
end
then see the database by doing the following:
rake db:seed

10. In the controller get all the cars from the database
class CarsController < ApplicationController   def index     @cars = Cars.all   end end

11. In apps/views/index.html.erb display your cars or whittles else you want to show
In the test case this is:


<h2>Products</h2>
  <ul>
   <% @products.each do |product| %>
    <li><%= product.name %></li>
    <% end %>
</ul>
